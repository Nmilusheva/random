1.	I open the Ubuntu virtual machine; open the terminal by pressing Ctrl + Alt + T on the keyboard; create a new file called "friends.txt" by typing the following command and pressing Enter “touch friends.txt”; Open the "friends.txt" file in the Nano text editor by typing the following command and pressing Enter “nano friends.txt”; ype the names of your three friends on separate lines, for example Maria, Ivan, Petar; Press Ctrl + X to exit Nano, then press Y to save the changes, and press Enter to confirm the filename.
2.	Using the following command “cat friends.txt”. This will print the contents of the "friends.txt" file to the console.
3.	Using the following command “mv friends.txt bestfriends.txt”. After running this command, I verify that the file has been renamed by using the "ls".
4.	Using the following command “cp bestfriends.txt sysadmins.txt”. After running this command, I verify that the file has been renamed by using the "ls".
5.	Using the following command “ls b*.txt” we list the files that match our pattern, for example the command will output bestfriends.txt
6.	I type in “wc -c sysadmins.txt” -> "wc" command stands for "word count" and counts the number of lines, words, and characters in a file. The "-c" option tells "wc" to count the number of bytes in the file.
7.	“echo -e "Toyota\nHonda\nFord\nChevrolet\nTesla" > cars.txt”  I run this command, ater running this command, I use the "cat" command to verify that the file has been created and contains the expected list of brands.
8.	I basically used the method from point 6  “wc -c cars.txt”
9.	“cp cars.txt /tmp”  I am copying the file "cars.txt" to the directory "/tmp", after running this command, I can verify that the file has been copied by using the "ls" command to list the files in the directory "/tmp"
10.	“ls /tmp/*.txt”  the 'ls' command lists the files that match this pattern.
11.	“mv /tmp/cars.txt /tmp/vehicles.txt”  I am renaming the file "cars.txt" to "vehicles.txt" in the directory "/tmp". “ls /tmp”  This should show the file "vehicles.txt" in the list of files, and "cars.txt" should no longer be present.
12.	“less /etc/passwd”  this command opens the "/etc/passwd" file in an interactive viewer that allows you to scroll up and down through the file.
